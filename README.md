# Vue OMDB Movie Search App

A simple app created for the Shopify UX Developer Intern & Web Developer Intern Challenge. This app uses Babel, Webpack, Node, Express, OMDB API, Sweetalert 2, and Bootstrap. The user is able to make a movie search and select up to 5 movies to nominate for "The Shoppies." Hope you enjoy!
